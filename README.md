# Spotify playlist sorter

This script sorts your Spotify playlist.

Sorting of the playlist follows these rules:

1. Duplicate tracks will be removed.
2. Tracks are sorted into groups of albums, that are ordered in the manner of the album.
3. Albums are grouped by artist and release date. (Artist is determined from the album rather than the track)
4. Artist groups are sorted depending on the first tracks appearance date on the playlist.
